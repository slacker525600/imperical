clone of custom boardgame 

Currently a react frontend that does nothing 
and an express backend that does next to nothing. 
README files in those folders are copies of boilerplate apps 

But ... they both build, theres a concept of a scoring grid on the frontend 
backend can instantiate something that looks like the state of the game 
rules are not in place, 
some comments exist about where some rules might get put in place, 
... 
starting point. 

why not use github for all the things. .... ? 
feature requests, bug fixes 
use github actions for builds
